\section{Conclusion}

Now you may ask yourself: how will the Higgs discovery affect me? How will this reflect on our daily lives? If the so
called ``God particle'' will be excluded, will this mean the end of the world? Well, regardless of the outcome, nothing
will change. In the best case scenario, some Nobel prizes will be awarded to the top brass and that's it. There is no bigger
mystery behind it apart from that the media created. These experiments serve only to round up the Standard Model and
the electroweak theory. Even if in the Higgs boson will be excluded, many technological breakthroughs had to be made
in other engineering sciences for the construction of such complex experiments so regardless of the outcome, we are gaining
something.

The Higgs boson mass has been narrowed down experimentally to 115 < $M_H$ < 127 (CMS) < 131 (ATLAS) GeV, with $\approx 4.7$ fb$^{-1}$
of data (integrated luminosity). After this year LHC will shut down for a longer period and resume in two years, hopefully
with it's design $\sqrt{s}$ and luminosity (this year the collisions are at $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV). During this shutdown, there
is enough data waiting to be analyzed.
